# Large-Language-Models-for-DNA-Sequence-Classification

## Introduction

The Large-Language-Models-for-DNA-Sequence-Classification project aims to explore the flexibility of using large language models for analyzing DNA sequence.



### Model

You can find the fine-tuned model for antimicrobial drug classification on Hugging Face at the following link:
